# YouTube Downloader

This project provides a boilerplate implementation allowing one to download
video or audio streams from YouTube, thanks to [LuanRT](https://github.com/LuanRT)'s work.

It is based on the [googlevideo](https://github.com/luanrt/googlevideo) project.

I've tried to do this myself, but didn't succeed for some reason.

I was able to download `videoplayback` YouTube files containing streams, parse
and interpret them, but not to concatenate the streams into a single file.

I tried my best, but now it's time to use a reliable solution that solves my
problems.
